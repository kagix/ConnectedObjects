This project uses a 8x8 LED matrix to display the waiting time for the next bus. It simulates the existing displays found at bus stops in Paris. While the real stops (abribus) may have cost a lot of money, the devices from this project are quite cheap. One ESP8266 board and one 8x8 LED matrix and that's all.One more thing. In order to retrieve the waiting time, the ESP connects to a web server every 60 seconds. The bus line and the bus stop are hard coded, but it should be possible to add a maintenance mode where the bus stop is set.
